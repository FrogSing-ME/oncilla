# Important Notice

These blueprints are outdated. They feature a VSERVO output of 6V,
instead of the required 9V. However from the BoM data sent to the
manufacturer, it should be 6V. Apparently the boards have been manually
changed to provide the required 9V.


A.Tuleu comment: I need to have physical access to one of the board to
notice how the changes were implemented and report it in the
blueprint. will be done on the 11th of April 2014.
